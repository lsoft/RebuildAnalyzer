# Rebuild Analyzer

An utility which analyzes your slnf/sln/csproj/shproj against a given changeset (the list of files) to determine what you need to rebuild. It is really works!

## Status

Prerelease version.

Issues with repro will be appreciated.

## How it works

This utility parses your `slnf`/`sln`/`csproj` files to discover all included items and check it against an incoming changeset to determine if this slnf/sln/csproj has affected by the changeset.

Parsing is powered by `Microsoft.Build` nuget.

## Notes

1. Changeset MUST be something that comes from a programmer: it MUST NOT include changes in autogenerated files or other "non-permanent files".
2. Changes in `props` files itself threats as `everything has changed`.
3. Changes in `sln`/`csproj`/`shproj` files itself threats as `everything which includes these changed sln/csproj`.
